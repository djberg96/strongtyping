== 2.0.7 - 1-Sep-2011
* Code reorganized, Rakefile added, CHANGES file added.
* Updated gemspec. Removed old has_rdoc call, added license.
* Fixes for 1.9.x. Still some warnings but harmless.
* Added a StrongTyping::VERSION constant.

== 2.0.6b
* Bugfix: Shouldn't get "too many arguments" on gcc any more.

== 2.0.6a
* Bugfix: Portability issues (zero-sized arrays and UNUSED for non-GNU
  platforms) fixed.
   
== 2.0.6
* Bugfix: Types given after lists of types were not being checked, as in
  the following:
   
    expect(a, String, b, [Integer, String], d, String)
   
  Before, 'd' could be any type and pass; now this is fixed.
   
== 2.0.5
* Bugfix: overload "No matching template" was broken, and I didn't notice.
* Bugfix: get_arg_types fixed for no arguments; now returns []
  in the right places for both overload() and expect().
* Mod: Should compile without warnings with -W -Wall, at least on gcc.
* Mod: Added unit tests.
   
== 2.0.4
* Bugfix: Optional arguments are now handled correctly when doing get_arg_types.
   
== 2.0.3
* It's a bit of a hack, but overload_default's "No matching
  template" error now displays the given types, which makes
  debugging a lot easier.
   
== 2.0.2
* Change Object#type to Object#class for conformance with Ruby 1.8.
* Bugfix: overload() range check that caused a segfault on some systems.
* Bugfix: verify_args_for() should work now.
     
== 2.0.1
* Bugfix: overload() blocks with one parameter now receive the parameter
  instead of an array.
   
== 2.0
* Rewritten in C for speed.
* As in 1.0.1, expect (and overload, etc) take arrays of classes/modules
* overload_error is deprecated (but still available) in favor of overload_default
* overload_exception acts as overload, but acts as an "invalid" case; useful
  for invalid cases where a specific exception should be thrown
* More on "duck typing" in the FAQ
     
== 1.0.1 - [Not officially released]
* Added support for arrays of types to expect(), as in expect(a, [Integer, NilClass])

== 1.0
* First release
